# Easy Games Repository
Description: Welcome to my little corner of gaming fun! 🎮 This is a collection of simple games I whipped up during my free time—not just to flex my coding skills but also because I saw someone else do it and thought, “Hey, I can totally pull that off!” Plus, there’s nothing like jamming to some music while replicating these games to make coding feel like a party. So grab a snack, and let’s play!
